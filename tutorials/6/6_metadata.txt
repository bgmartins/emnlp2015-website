Abstract#==#Computational linguistics has witnessed a surge of interest in approaches to
emotion and affect analysis, tackling problems that extend beyond sentiment
analysis, in depth and complexity. This area involves basic emotions (such as
joy, sadness, and fear) as well as any of the hundreds of other emotions humans
are capable of (such as optimism, frustration, and guilt), expanding into
affective conditions, experiences, and activities. Leveraging linguistic data
for computational affect and emotion inference enables opportunities to address
a range of affect-related tasks, problems, and non-invasive applications that
capture aspects essential to the human condition and individualsâ€™ cognitive
processes. These efforts enable and facilitate human-centered computing
experiences, as demonstrated by applications across clinical, socio-political,
artistic, educational, and commercial domains.

There is a substantial body of work in traditional sentiment analysis (focusing
on positive and negative sentiment). This tutorial will cover approaches and
features that migrate well to affect analysis. We will also discuss key
differences from sentiment analysis, and their implications for analyzing
affect and emotion.
