Abstract#==#The availability of textual data and the development of powerful NLP
technologies, invite the challenge of automatically measuring personality
dimensions in textual data for various applications from granular analytics of
customers to the forensic identification of potential offenders.

While there are emerging attempts to address this challenge (such as the recent
"Computational Personality" Workshops, e.g. Celli et al., 2013), these attempts
almost exclusively focus on one theoretical model of personality and on
classification tasks that are limited when tagged data are not available.

The major aim of the proposed tutorial is to provide NLP researchers with an
introduction to personality theories that may empower their scope of research.
