Abstract#==#Our tutorial will focus on the need for showcasing the new research studies and
techniques for Natural Language Processing of social media texts. We will
present text analysis techniques for social media data in the context of
natural language understanding, natural language generation, automatic
categorization, topic detection, trend and interest exploration, emotion
analysis, and applications using a variety of computational approaches to
process large amounts of data. 

The content of the tutorial will be based on chapters 3 and 4 of our upcoming
book. The first part of the tutorial will focus on several tasks for semantic
analysis of social media texts, such as: geo-location detection, opinion mining
and emotion analysis, event and topic detection, entity linking and
disambiguation, summarization in social media, and machine translation in
social media. The second part of the tutorial will focus on real-world
applications of social media text analysis such as: health care applications
financial applications, predicting voting intentions, media monitoring,
security and defence applications, NLP-based information visualisation for
social media, disaster response applications, NLP-based user modelling and
applications for entertainment.
