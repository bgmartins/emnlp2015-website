Abstract#==#Semantic similarity forms a central component in many NLP systems, from lexical
semantics, to part of speech tagging, to social media analysis. While work on
semantic similarity is long standing, recent years have seen a renewed interest
in developing new techniques, buoyed by the SemEval tasks in Semantic Textual
Similarity and the recent task of Cross-Level Semantic Similarity, which has
led to new semantic similarity methods that are effective across all types of
inputs, e.g,. concepts, phrases, or even paragraphs. This renewed interest has
led to hundreds of techniques for measuring semantic similarity, which makes it
difficult for practitioners to identify which state-of-the-art techniques are
applicable to their areas and may easily be integrated and for researchers to
identify which aspects of the problem require future research. 

This tutorial synthesizes the current state of the art for measuring semantic
similarity for all types of conceptual or textual pairs and presents a broad
overview of current techniques, what resources they use, and the particular
inputs or domains to which the methods are most applicable. We survey methods
ranging from corpus-based approaches operating on massive or domains-specific
corpora to those leveraging structural information from expert-based or
collaboratively-constructed lexical resources. We review work on individual
similarity tasks (e.g., word comparison) for those interested in a single
comparison type, while also providing a review of general-purpose methods. Our
tutorial provides practitioners who need out of the box solutions with a clear
overview of currently-available tools and each toolsâ€™ strength and provides
researchers with an understanding of current state of the art and what open
problems remain in the field.
