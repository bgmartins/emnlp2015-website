Abstract#==#This tutorial examines the role of knowledge in information retrieval in
general, and Web search in particular. Knowledge is available as instances,
classes and relations that are either available in human-generated resources,
or extracted automatically from text. The tutorial teaches the audience about
characteristics, advantages and limitations of human-generated knowledge
resources, and knowledge extracted from the Web; the role of knowledge
resources in enhancing information retrieval; and implications in information
access and retrieval in general.
