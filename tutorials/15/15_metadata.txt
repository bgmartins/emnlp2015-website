Abstract#==#Although most recent IE research focuses on techniques that are opaque—not
transparent—there is a significant minority by various researchers from
industry and academia that does not. The main goal of our tutorial is to
highlight this line of work and motivate new research directions that will lead
to more transparent machine learning in IE, resulting in greater impact in
solving real-world problems. We categorize, compare and analyze recent advances
in this area, providing a systematic view of the state-of-the-art. We cover
transparent machine learning techniques for both learning features useful for
information extraction, as well as learning complete extractors. We also share
our experience and lessons learned on building an enterprise information
extraction
system integrated with multiple transparent machine learning techniques.
