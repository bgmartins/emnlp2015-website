Abstract#==#This tutorial will give participants a solid understanding of the linguistic
features of multiword expressions (MWEs), focusing on the semantics of such
expressions and their importance for natural language processing and language
technology, with particular attention to the way that FrameNet
(framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu) handles this wide spread phenomenon. Our target
audience includes researchers and practitioners of language technology, not
necessarily experts in MWEs or knowledgeable about FrameNet, who are interested
in NLP tasks that involve or could benefit from considering MWEs as a pervasive
phenomenon in human language and communication.
