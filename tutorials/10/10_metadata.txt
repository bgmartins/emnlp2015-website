Abstract#==#Every non-trivial text describes interactions and relations between people,
institutions, activities, events and so on. What we know about the world
consists in large part of such relations, and that knowledge contributes to the
understanding of what texts refer to. Newly found relations can in turn become
part of the knowledge stored for future use.

To grasp a text's semantic content, an automatic system must be able to
recognize relations in texts and reason about them. This may be done by
applying and updating previously acquired knowledge. We focus here in
particular on semantic relations which describe the interactions among nouns
and compact noun phrases, and we present such relations from both a theoretical
and a practical perspective. The theoretical exploration sketches the
historical path which has brought us to the contemporary view and
interpretation of semantic relations. We discuss a wide range of relation
inventories proposed by linguists and by language processing people. Such
inventories vary by domain, granularity and suitability for downstream
applications.

On the practical side, we investigate the recognition and acquisition of
relations from texts. In a look at supervised learning methods, we present
available datasets, the variety of features which can describe relation
instances, and learning algorithms found appropriate for the task. Next, we
present weakly supervised and unsupervised learning methods of acquiring
relations from large corpora with little or no previously annotated data. We
show how enduring the bootstrapping algorithm based on seed examples or
patterns has proved to be, and how it has been adapted to tackle Web-scale text
collections. We also show a few machine learning techniques which can perform
fast and reliable relation extraction by taking advantage of data redundancy
and variability.
