				About Lisbon
			</h2>
			<p>
				Situated in the west coast of Portugal, where the Tagus river meets the Atlantic Ocean, Lisbon is the capital of Portugal and the westernmost capital in mainland Europe. The light, the atmosphere, and the climate offer marvelous walks all over the city. Lisbon is an extremely lively city, with a wealth of cultural events happening every day, and a vibrant nightlife. A huge selection of <a href="restaurants.html">restaurants</a> is available, featuring Portuguese and international cuisine.
			</p>
			<p>
				The public transportation system is far-reaching and reliable, and has the Metro (subway) as its main backbone. Lisbon can also be easily reached by daily direct flights from major international cities. The city stretches along the northern bank of the river Tejo as it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. There are several beaches a few minutes away from the center. As the terrain rises north away from the water, steep streets and stairways from the old tangled neighborhoods or give way to green parks in the western suburbs.
			</p>
			<p>
				The city has also experienced a renaissance in recent years, with a contemporary culture that is alive and thriving and making its mark in today's Europe. Perched on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, Lisbon is one of the rare Western European cities that face the ocean and uses water as an element that defines the city. Lisbon enchants travelers with its white bleached limestone buildings, intimate alleyways, and an easy going charm that makes it a popular year round destination.

				FAQ about Visiting Lisbon
			</h2>
			<h3>
				Where is Lisbon?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Lisbon is located on the coast of Portugal, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, west central Portugal and at the mouth of the Tagus River. The city is the westernmost capital of a mainland European country. Portugal itself lies at mainland Europe’s western most point, where the inland Mediterranean Sea meets the Atlantic Ocean, and is simultaneously the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula with Spain as its sole land border. More information is available on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon">Wikipedia article on Lisbon</a>, and also on the <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Lisbon">Wikitravel article about Lisbon</a>.

			</p>
			<h3>
				Where is the conference venue?
			</h3>
			<p>
				EMNLP 2015 will take place at <a href="http://www.culturgest.pt">Culturgest</a>, a foundation with an important place in Lisbon’s cultural scene, located right at the heart of the city and close to <a href="http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">Instituto Superior Técnico</a>, the Engineering School of the <a href="http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">University of Lisbon</a>. Culturgest is physically located at the head building of Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD), an important Portuguese state bank. The foundation is a part of the bank itself, and it features exhibition centers, showrooms, and rooms for theater, cinema or meetings, on the underground floors of CGD's head building.
			</p>
			<p>
				Culturgest regularly offers some of the best cultural activities in town, with a <a href="http://www.culturgest.pt/actual/programa.html">programme</a> that consists of an eclectic mix of exhibitions, cinema cycles, concerts, conferences and dance performances, all at very affordable prices with discounts for students &amp; people under 30/over 65. The foundation also supplies services to other companies, hiring out its facilities for performances, conferences, meetings and other events, specifically maintaining close links with schools, universities and other educational institutions.
			</p>

			<h3>

According to the Global Peace Index from 2014, Portugal is ranked #18, ahead of many other European countries. (References: <a href="http://economicsandpeace.org/research/iep-indices-data/global-peace-index">Institute for Economics and Peace</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Peace_Index">Wikipedia</a>)
			</p>
			<h3>
				What is there to do in Lisbon?
			</h3>
			<p>
				There is plenty to keep you busy in Lisbon. The westerner southern European capital is probably one of the most beautiful, breathtaking and not overwhelmingly touristy world-class cities, with plenty of history and architectural gems, great food, extremely friendly people and unbeatable good weather. Some highlights include:

			<h4>
				How do I get around in Lisbon?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Lisbon has a very efficient <a href="http://www.transporteslisboa.pt">public transport network</a> that covers the entire city in addition to the surrounding areas. Lisbon's recently refurbished <a href="http://metro.transporteslisboa.pt/eng/">metro system</a> is clean, quick, and efficient. While metro announcements are made only in Portuguese, signs and ticketing machines are generally bilingual in Portuguese and English. The extensive bus and electrico (tram) network is run by <a href="http://carris.transporteslisboa.pt/en/home/">Carris</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The best and, in many cases, the sole way to pay for city transport is buying a rechargeable green-colored card 7 Colinas (Viva Viagem). It is valid for metro, trams (electrico), urban trains, most buses and ferries. The exception is buses run not by Carris—other bus companies have their own tickets. The card itself can be purchased for €0.50 (this price doesn't include any trips—add as many trips as you want), and remains valid for a year.
			</p>
			<p>
				Taxis are also widely available. They are usually cream in colour, although there are still some painted black with a green roof in the traditional Portuguese style. The fare is shown on the taximeter and the prices are usually affixed inside the car, or you can ask the driver about them. If you phone for a taxi you have to pay an extra 0.80 euros. There is a charge of 1.60 euros for luggage, regardless of weight or the number of pieces. Carry cots, pushchairs, wheelchairs and walking aids are carried free of charge. Outside towns, transport by taxi is paid per kilometre, and the passenger is informed of the amount in advance. Where they exist, the passenger has to pay the road tolls there and back.
			</p>
			<p>
				If your accommodation is in the center of Lisbon, walking or cycling are both great alternatives. Many of the attractions of the city, such as the <a href="http://castelodesaojorge.pt/en">Castelo</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfama">Alfama</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bairro_Alto">Bairro Alto</a> districts, are within easy walking distance of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon_Baixa">Baixa</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				People visiting Lisbon can use a national licence from any country to drive a car, although licences issued in some countries are not valid in Portugal beyond a fixed period. Licences issued by EU and EEA countries are valid in Portugal, and need not be exchanged while they remain valid. Driving should nonetheless be avoided within the city, due to the busy traffic and narrow streets. Traffic drives on the right in Portugal and international traffic signs are used. The minimum age for driving is 18 years. Speed limits are 120kph (74mph) on motorways, 90kph (56mph) outside built-up areas, and 50kph (30mph) in towns.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Do I need to know Portuguese to get around?
			</h4>
			<p>
				While Portuguese is the official language, English is also widely spoken, particularly among students and by all people who work within the tourist industry. Traffic signs on the roads, and general signs and ticketing machines on the public transportation network are usually bilingual in Portuguese and English, although metro announcements are made only in Portuguese.
