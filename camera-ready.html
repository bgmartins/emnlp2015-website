			<h3>
				When and where do I send my final camera-ready paper?
			</h3>
			<p>
				The deadline is August 14, 2015 (at 11:59pm, UTC/GMT -11 hours). You may submit the final version of your paper by navigating to the <a href="https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2015/papers/">EMNLP 2015 START login</a> and following the internal links.
			</p>
			<h3>
				How should the final copy differ from the original submission?
			</h3>
			<p>
				The camera-ready version of your paper should incorporate the comments of the reviewers as well as other changes you see fit to make. In addition, be sure to do all of the following:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ensure that your paper conforms to the <a href="submissions.html">provided styles, font and page size</a>.</li>
				<li>Include the authors' names and affiliations under the title.</li>
				<li>De-anonymize references to your own work in the body of the paper.</li>
				<li>Where appropriate, add acknowledgments for colleagues, reviewers, and grants.</li>
				<li>Ensure that all tables, graphs, and figures are readable when viewed in black and white.</li>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>
				How long can it be?
			</h3>
			<p>
For both long and short papers, we allow one extra page of content and unlimited reference pages to help address reviewer comments.
			</p>
			<p>
Long papers are permitted at most 9 pages of text and unlimited pages containing only references. Short papers get 5 pages of text plus unlimited pages for references.
			</p>
			<h3>
				What is the format for the camera-ready copy?
			</h3>
			<p>
The file must be in Portable Document Format (PDF) on A4 paper. We require the use of <a href="submissions.html">ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files tailored for this year's EMNLP conference</a>. You can view the style files and detailed formatting instructions on the web.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are using LaTeX, please create the PDF file with <code>pdflatex</code> or <code>xelatex.</code> This ensures use of the proper Type 1 fonts and also takes advantage of other PDF features. You will have the best results using a modern LaTeX distribution, in particular, <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX live</a> (TeX Live 2013 is available). Using the geometry package to set the A4 format is recommended. <!--
<h3>How do I ensure that my file is correctly formatted?</h3>
 <ul>

<li>Make sure the paper is <a href="http://cherryc.github.io/naacl-pubs/camera-ready-faq.html#format-size">US Letter-sized</a>.
<li>Adjust the <a href="http://cherryc.github.io/naacl-pubs/camera-ready-faq.html#format-margins">margin offsets</a> when uploading.
<li>Embed <a href="http://cherryc.github.io/naacl-pubs/camera-ready-faq.html#format-fonts">custom fonts</a>.
<li>If your paper uses Asian fonts, please ensure that they are embedded in the PDF file so that they can be displayed by non-Asian versions of the PDF reader. (Asian versions ship with a larger set of default fonts.)
 </ul>

			</p>
			<h3>
				What if my paper includes graphics?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Remember that you are providing a camera-ready copy. Thus, artwork and photos should be included directly in the paper in their final positions. Ideally, you should use vector graphic formats (PDF, EPS), which allow the graphics to scale arbitrarily. Avoid GIF or JPEG images that are low resolution or highly compressed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your paper must look good both when printed (A4 size, black-and-white) and when viewed on screen as PDF (zoomable to any size, color okay). Thus, you may want to use color high-resolution graphics, allowing readers to zoom in on a graph and study it. However, <strong>please</strong> check that the same graph or photograph is legible when printed on a black-and-white printer. For example, different lines in a graph should not be distinguished only by color, although they can <strong>also</strong> be distinguished by color.
			</p>
			<p>
				A good test is to print the paper on your own black-and-white laser printer, and to view it in a PDF viewer at different resolutions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Don't go overboard on resolution; keep file sizes manageable. Note that vector graphics (e.g., encapsulated PostScript) look good at any scale and take up little space (unless you are plotting many thousands of data points).
			</p>
			<h3>
				What about copyright?
			</h3>
			<p>
				When you submit the paper, you will be asked to sign electronically (via the START Conference Manager) or physically the <a href="templates/ACL2012.copyright.pdf">ACL Copyright Transfer Agreement</a> on behalf of all authors. Authors retain many rights under this agreement and it is appropriate in the vast majority of cases. Please contact the publication chairs <a href="mailto:daniele.pighin@gmail.com">Daniele Pighin</a> and <a href="mailto:yuvalmarton@gmail.com">Yuval Marton</a> with any concerns regarding copyright.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before signing this form, please confirm with your co-authors (and, if applicable, your and their employers) that they authorize you to sign on their behalf.
			</p>
			<h3>
				What if my paper's title or author list has changed?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Then please edit those metadata fields when you upload the camera-ready version, so that they will appear correctly in the table of contents, author index, conference schedule, etc. Please also note that your name will appear in conference metadata as you have configured it in Softconf's system, so make sure that it is correct there (e.g., capitalization, full name, etc). You can change this on the user settings page of the <a href="https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2015/papers/">START conference manager</a>, under "User" > "Account Information" > "Update Profile".
