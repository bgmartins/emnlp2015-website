   </ul>

<p>All deadlines are calculated at 11:59pm (UTC/GMT −11 hours)</p>

<h2 id="submission">Submissions</h2>

<p>Submissions should describe original, unpublished work. Papers
presented at EMNLP should mainly contain new material that has not
been presented at any other meeting with publicly available
proceedings. Papers that have been or will be submitted to other
meetings or publications must disclose this information at submission
time. Please list all other meetings where the paper has been
submitted in the "other submissions" field on the submission site (and
see below for details of the multiple submission policy).</p>

<p>Each <strong>long paper</strong> submission consists of a paper of up to nine (9) pages of content and any number of additional pages containing references only, together with optional supplementary material as described below.

<p>EMNLP 2014 also solicits short papers. Characteristics of short papers include:
  <ul>

 <li>A small, focused contribution
 <li>Work in progress
 <li>A negative result
 <li>An opinion piece
 <li>An interesting application nugget
 </ul>

<p>Each <strong>short paper</strong> submission consists of a paper of up to four (4) pages of content and 2 pages of additional pages containing references only, together with optional supplementary material as described below.  Each short paper submission will be reviewed by at least two program committee members. </p>

<p>For both long and short submissions, accepted papers will be presented orally or as a poster (at the discretion of the program chairs).  There will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally or as posters.</p>


<p>Both long and short papers should follow the two-column format of ACL 2014 proceedings. Please use the official <a href="templates.html">ACL 2014 style files</a> for the paper and ensure that your paper setting is A4 size (if using Latex, change \documentclass[11pt]{article} to \documentclass[11pt|a4paper]{article} ). We reserve the right to reject submissions if the paper does not conform to these styles, including letter size and font size restrictions.</p>

<p>As reviewing will be blind, the submission should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., &ldquo;We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...&rdquo;, should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as &ldquo;Smith (1991) previously showed ...&rdquo;. Submissions that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Separate author identification information is required as part of the on-line submission process.</p>

<p>The <strong>supplementary material</strong> should be supplementary (rather than
central) to the paper. It may include explanations or details of
proofs or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of
features or feature templates, sample inputs and outputs for a system,
pseudo-code or source code, and data. The paper should not rely on the
supplementary material: while the paper may refer to and cite the
supplementary material and the supplementary material will be
available to reviewers, they will not be asked to review or even
download the supplementary material.</p>

<p>Submission and reviewing will be on-line, managed by the START system.
The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. The
supplementary material must be in the form of a single .zip or a .tgz
archive file with a maximum size of 10MB; otherwise there are no
constraints on its format. Submissions, together with all
supplementary material, must be uploaded to the START system by the
submission deadlines; submissions submitted after that time will not
be reviewed. To minimize network congestion we request authors upload
their submissions as early as possible (especially if they contain
large supplementary material files).</p>

<p>We are now accepting long and short paper submissions on SoftConf: <a href="https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2014/papers/">www.softconf.com/emnlp2014/papers/</a>.

<h2>EMNLP multiple submission policy</h2>
<ul>
<li> Papers presented at an EMNLP conference must represent new work that has not been previously published. It is the responsibility of the author to inform the program chair of any potential problems with respect to this requirement, as noted in the following guidelines.</li>
<li> Papers that have appeared at a conference with published proceedings constitute previously published work.</li>
<li> Papers that overlap with other papers that have appeared at a conference with published proceedings must contain significant new results. </li>
<li> The program co-chairs have the final decision about what constitutes significant new results.</li>
<li> Papers that have appeared at a workshop do not constitute previously published work, as long as the paper submitted to EMNLP is an extension of the workshop paper. </li>
<li> Extensions might include new results, more in-depth analysis, evaluation that was not part of the workshop paper, or further experiments. </li>
<li> The program co-chairs have the final decision about whether the EMNLP submission represents an extension of any previous publication.</li>
<li> Papers posted on arXiv or the authors’ web pages do not constitute previously published work for the purposes of EMNLP 2014 reviewing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementation of EMNLP multiple submission policy</h2>

<p>Authors of papers being submitted both to EMNLP and to other editorial venues (e.g., conferences, journals, workshops) must provide the name of such venues at the submission time: there will be an input box to enter this information in the EMNLP submission form of SoftConf START system. </p>
<p>In case a paper is both accepted to EMNLP and to other venues, the authors must choose to publish or not such paper with EMNLP and comunicate their choice to the EMNLP PC chairs, within one week from the EMNLP acceptance notification. If the authors choose EMNLP they must withdraw the paper from all the other venues, otherwise they must withdraw their paper from EMNLP.</p>

<!-- <h2 id="multiple-submissions">Multiple Submission Policy</h2>

<p>Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time. To alleviate review duplication, multiple submissions are only allowed over a narrow time window, up until July 12, 2013. By this date, authors of co-submitted papers must notify the PC Chairs of their decision to either (a) withdraw the paper from EMNLP; or (b) withdraw the paper from the other venues it was co-submitted to and have it reviewed for EMNLP only.

<p>There must be at least one registered author at the conference for each accepted paper, and all accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. It is not acceptable to submit papers that overlap significantly in content or results with work that will be (or has been) published elsewhere.

<p>Authors submitting more than one paper to EMNLP 2014 must ensure that submissions do not overlap significantly (> 50%) with each other in content or results. Authors should not submit short and long versions of papers with substantial overlap in their original contributions.

<h2 id="workshops">Workshops</h2>

<p>EMNLP 2013 will have three workshops, see the <a href="workshops.html">workshop list</a>.
