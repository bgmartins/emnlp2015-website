				Submissions
			</h2>
			<p>
				We are now accepting long and short paper submissions on SoftConf: <a href="https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2015/papers/">www.softconf.com/emnlp2015/papers/</a>.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Long papers
			</h3>
			<p>
				EMNLP 2015 submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each long paper submission consists of a paper of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus two pages for references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page (up to 9 pages with unlimited pages for references) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Short papers
			</h3>
			<p>
				EMNLP 2015 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. While a short paper is not a shortened long paper, the characteristics of short papers include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A small, focused contribution
				</li>
				<li>Work in progress
				</li>
				<li>A negative result
				</li>
				<li>An opinion piece
				</li>
				<li>An interesting application nugget
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Each short paper submission consists of up to four (4) pages of content, plus 2 pages for references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) pages in the proceedings and unlimited pages for references. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers’ comments in their final versions. Each short paper submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Both long and short papers
			</h3>
			<p>
				Papers may be accompanied by the resources (software and/or data) described in the papers. Papers that are submitted with accompanying software/data may receive additional credit toward the overall evaluation score, and the potential impact of the software and data will be taken into account when making the acceptance/rejection decisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Papers may be accompanied with material such as explanations or details of proofs or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of features or feature templates, sample inputs and outputs for a system, pseudo-code or source code, and data. The paper should not rely on the supplementary material: while the paper may refer to and cite the supplementary material and the supplementary material will be available to reviewers, they will not be asked to review or even download the supplementary material.
			</p>
			<p>
				Accepted papers will be presented orally or as a poster (at the discretion of the program chairs). There will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally or as posters. TACL papers presented at EMNLP will also be presented as orally or posters in the same proportion as papers that were submitted directly to the conference.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Formatting
			</h3>
			<p>
				Both long and short papers should follow the two-column format to be provided at the conference site. We reserve the right to reject submissions if the paper does not conform to these styles, including paper size and font size restrictions.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the reviewing will be blind, papers should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...”, should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith (1991) previously showed ...”. Submissions that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Separate author identification information is required as part of the on-line submission process.
			</p>
			<p>
				Submission will be online, managed by the <a href="https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2015/papers">SoftConf system</a>. The site is now open. To minimize network congestion we request authors upload their submissions as early as possible.
			</p>
			<h3>
				EMNLP multiple submission policy
			</h3>
			<p>
				Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted by EMNLP 2015. We will not accept for publication or presentation papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.
			</p>
			<p>
				Authors submitting more than one paper to EMNLP 2015 must ensure that submissions do not overlap significantly (&gt;25%) with each other in content or results.
			</p>
			<p>
				Preprint servers such as arXiv.org and ACL-related workshops that do not have published proceedings in the ACL Anthology are not considered archival for purposes of submission. Authors must state in the online submission form the name of the workshop or preprint server and title of the non-archival version. The submitted version should be suitably anonymized and not contain references to the prior non-archival version. Reviewers will be told: "The author(s) have notified us that there exists a non-archival previous version of this paper with significantly overlapping text. We have approved submission under these circumstances, but to preserve the spirit of blind review, the current submission does not reference the non-archival version." Reviewers are free to do what they like with this information.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Presentation requirement
			</h3>
			<p>
				All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for EMNLP 2015.
