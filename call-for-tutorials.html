				Call for Tutorials for <a href="index.html">EMNLP 2015</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				EMNLP will hold a tutorial session, and we seek proposals for tutorials on all topics of natural language processing, including phonology, morphology, segmentation and tagging, syntax and parsing, semantics, discourse, dialogue, pragmatics, language resources, summarization and generation, machine translation, question answering, information extraction, text mining and NLP applications, sentiment analysis and opinion mining, NLP for the Web and social media, computational models of human language processing. Especially encouraged are tutorials that educate the community about advancements in neighboring research areas such as machine learning, knowledge mining, information retrieval, speech processing, optimization, relevant other areas of artificial intelligence and linguistics, as well as applications of NLP to new domains or problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				Information on the payment for tutorial instructors will be published soon.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Submission Details
