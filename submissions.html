<h1>Instructions for Submitting a Paper</h1>

<h2>Formatting</h2>

<p>Each <strong>long paper</strong> submission consists of a paper of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus two pages for references. Final versions of long papers will be given one additional page (up to 9 pages with 2 pages for references) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.

<p>Each <strong>short paper</strong> submission consists of a paper of up to four (4) pages of content and 2 pages for references. Final versions of short papers will also be given one additional page (up to 5 pages with 2 pages for references), so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.

<p>For both long and short submissions, accepted papers will be presented orally or as a poster (at the discretion of the program chairs).  There will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally or as posters.</p>

<p>Both long and short papers should follow the two-column format of ACL 2015 proceedings. Please use the official ACL 2015 style files for the paper and ensure that your paper setting is A4 size (if using Latex, make sure that your master document class is set to \documentclass[11pt|a4paper]{article} ). We reserve the right to reject submissions if the paper does not conform to these styles, including letter size and font size restrictions. Submission templates are available from the links below:</h1>
<h4>Templates for LaTeX:</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="./templates/acl2015.tex">acl2015.tex</a></li>
<li><a href="./templates/acl2015.sty">acl2015.sty</a></li>
<li><a href="./templates/acl2015.pdf">acl2015.pdf</a></li>
<li><a href="./templates/acl.bst">acl.bst</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Templates for MS Word:</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="./templates/acl2015.dot">acl2015.dot</a></li>
<li><a href="./templates/acl2015.pdf">acl2015.pdf</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As reviewing will be blind, the submission should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., &ldquo;We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...&rdquo;, should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as &ldquo;Smith (1991) previously showed ...&rdquo;. Submissions that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Separate author identification information is required as part of the on-line submission process.

<p>We are now accepting long and short paper submissions on SoftConf: <a href="https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2015/papers/">www.softconf.com/emnlp2015/papers/</a>.

<!--
<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>
To have a paper published at EMNLP, at least one of its authors must be registered to the conference.  Accepted papers are expected to be presented by one of the authors (or a substitute). Otherwise, please inform the PC co-chairs in a timely manner that the paper will not be presented (if you cannot find a substitute).
</p>
-->
	
<!--
<h2>Procedure and requirements</h2>

<p>Submission and reviewing will be on-line, managed by the START system at the following address
 <ul>

<li><a href="https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2015/papers/">https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2015/papers/</a>
 </ul>

<p>Submissions, together with all supplementary material, must be uploaded onto the START system by the submission deadlines; papers submitted after that time will not be reviewed. To minimise network congestion we request that authors upload their submissions as early as possible (especially if they contain large supplementary material files).

<h3>Multiple submission policy</h3>

<p>Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time. To alleviate review duplication, multiple submissions are only allowed over a narrow time window, up until July 12, 2013. By this date, authors of co-submitted papers must notify the PC Chairs of their decision to either (a) withdraw the paper from EMNLP; or (b) withdraw the paper from the other venues it was co-submitted to and have it reviewed for EMNLP only.
