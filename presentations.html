				Instructions for presenters
			</h1>
			<h2>
				Guidelines for oral presentations
			</h2>
			<p>
				Presentation time is 25 minutes for <strong>long</strong> papers and 20 minutes for <strong>short</strong> papers, including introductions, questions and switching between presentations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please plan for your actual presentation to last <strong>no more than</strong> 20 minutes if you have a long paper and 15 minutes if you have a short paper. It is important that the sessions remain on time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please note that this year we are following a different procedure regarding oral presentation:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you cannot use your laptop: you need to load your presentation in the laptop provided by the organizing committee;
				</li>
				<li>you can only deliver your slides in PDF format; and
				</li>
				<li>you must give your PDF file to the technical staff, who will be on hand to assist you. You should arrive to your session room 15 minutes before the session starts to meet with your session chair (i.e., during the break immediately preceding your session).
				</li>
			</ul><!-- <p>You are expected to put your presentation in PDF format ONLY on the presentation laptop by the break immediately preceding your session at the latest; technical staff will be on hand to assist you. You should arrive to your session room 15 minutes before the session starts to meet with your session chair.</p> -->
			<h2>
				Guidelines for poster presentations
			</h2>
			<p>
				We request that your posters be at most A0 size (84 cm wide x 118 cm high — 33.1 in × 46.8 in) in either portrait or landscape. Materials for attaching posters to poster boards (push-pins, double-sided tape, etc.) will be provided.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please affix your poster to your assigned poster board prior to your specified poster session, i.e., during the break immediately preceding your session. Please note that there will be multiple poster sessions, each with only 10-15 posters with a particular theme (just like oral presentation sessions). Thus, you will need to remove your poster immediately the end of your session, i.e., exactly when the next break starts.
			</p>
			<p>
				The organizing committee chose to have more poster sessions with fewer papers, giving these sessions an equal footing to the oral sessions. Hopefully, the poster sessions will be as well attended as oral sessions.
			</p><!-- </p> A chair will be provided at each position. Please affix your poster to your assigned poster board prior to your specified poster session. Please note that there will be multiple poster sessions.</p> -->
