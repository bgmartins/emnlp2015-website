				Instructions for presenters
			</h1>
			<h2>
				Guidelines for oral presentations
			</h2>
			<p>
				Presentation time is 25 minutes for <strong>long</strong> papers and 15 minutes for <strong>short</strong> papers, including introductions, questions and switching between presentations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please plan for your actual presentation to last <strong>no more than</strong> 20 minutes if you have a long paper and 12 minutes if you have a short paper. This allows 5 minutes (for long papers) and 3 minutes (for short papers) for questions and switching presenters. It is very important that the sessions remain on time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please note that we are following the procedure below for oral presentations:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<!-- <li>you should not use your laptop: you need to load your presentation in the laptop provided by the organizing committee; -->
				<li>you should preferably load your presentation into the laptop provided by the organizing committee;
				</li>				
				<li>you can deliver your slides in PDF or PPT format;
				</li>
				<li>you should give your PDF or PPT file to the support staff, who will be on hand to assist you;</li> 
				<li>you should arrive to your session room 15 minutes before the session starts to meet with your session chair (i.e., during the break immediately preceding your session); and
				</li>
				<li>if you prefer to use your own laptop, you should also show up early to check the computer connection and the slides with the support staff and the session chair.
				</li>
			</ul><!-- <p>You are expected to put your presentation in PDF format ONLY on the presentation laptop by the break immediately preceding your session at the latest; technical staff will be on hand to assist you. You should arrive to your session room 15 minutes before the session starts to meet with your session chair.</p> -->
			<h2>
				Guidelines for poster presentations
			</h2>
			<p>
				We request that your posters be at most A0 size (84 cm wide x 118 cm high — 33.1 in × 46.8 in) in a portrait orientation. Materials for attaching posters to poster boards (push-pins, double-sided tape, etc.) will be provided. The poster boards have approximately 1m length x 2m height.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please affix your poster to your assigned poster board prior to your specified poster session, i.e., during the break immediately preceding your session. We have scheduled two parallel poster sessions with clusters of papers in the same topics that run simultaneously to the oral presentation sessions. You will need to remove your poster immediately the end of your session, i.e., exactly when the next break starts.
			</p>
			<p>
				The organizing committee has chosen to have more poster sessions with fewer papers, giving these sessions an equal footing to the oral sessions. Hopefully, the poster sessions will be as well attended as oral sessions.
			</p><!-- </p> A chair will be provided at each position. Please affix your poster to your assigned poster board prior to your specified poster session. Please note that there will be multiple poster sessions.</p> -->
